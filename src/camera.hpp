/** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** Abstract Camera for ray tracing. Must be defined for a scene to produce an image.
 ** The resulting image size is defined in the camera to allow traversing
 ** all the pixels that need tracing.
 ** From this camera we create a pinhole camera but we could extend it to be a
 ** fish eye camera or something else.
