 ** Defines shape made out of many triangles. Contains a method for loading
 ** triangles and vertex normals from obj files. It's not a complete load though,
 ** it can't load texture coordinates and only works when there is a 1 to 1 match
 ** for vertices and vertex normals or there are no vertex normals.
